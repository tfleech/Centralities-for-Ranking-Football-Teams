# Centralities-for-Ranking-Football-Teams

This project ranks football teams based on the NCAA Division One 1990-91 season using various centrality measures and elo scores.  

cf1990gms.txt contains the dataset we used to build the graphs.  Elo.py contains the elo scoring function we used, provided by Heungsub Lee.  Project.py contains all of our code to retrieve the data, build the graph, and calculate the centralities.  There are several examples at the end of how to run each function.
